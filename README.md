# How to Play
The goal of the game is to get the player to the blue strip of tiles without hitting any of the enemies (bugs). The player can go left, right, up or down, but is confined to the 5x6 grid of the game. The player starts at the bottom, center tile. Three enemy bugs will be running along at different speeds in the top rows. The player wins the game by making it to any of the tile in the top blue stip. The game continues indefinitely, so after winning the game the player will be transported back to the initial starting position. The player is also transported to the initial starting position after hitting an enemy bug and dying.
